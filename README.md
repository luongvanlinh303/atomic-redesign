# Redefinition of Atoms - Atomic ReDesign -

## What is Atomic ReDesign?

"Atomic ReDesign" is an extension of the famous "Atomic Design". When designing components with React and Vue.js, we often had a headache. UI granularity classification constraints can prevent component design optimization.

There was no unified solution to the question, "Where do components of this granularity belong?", And it had to be determined by the nature of each product. Also, the scattered context caused a loss of concentration on the code.

Atomic ReDesign aims to capture the actual "difference between Atomic Design and application design" and become a realistic design guideline.
